## What is LinGoose?

[LinGoose](https://github.com/rsest/lingoose) is a Go framework for building awesome AI/LLM applications.<br/>

- **LinGoose is modular** ‚Äî You can import only the modules you need to build your application.
- **LinGoose is an abstraction of features** ‚Äî You can choose your preferred implementation of a feature and/or create your own.
- **LinGoose is a complete solution** ‚Äî You can use LinGoose to build your AI/LLM application from the ground up.

> **Did you know?** A goose ü™ø fills its car üöó with goose-line ‚õΩ!

## Quick start
1. [Initialise a new go module](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module)

```sh
mkdir example
cd example
go mod init example
```

2. Create your first LinGoose application

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/rsest/lingoose/llm/openai"
	"github.com/rsest/lingoose/thread"
)

func main() {
	myThread := thread.New().AddMessage(
		thread.NewUserMessage().AddContent(
			thread.NewTextContent("Tell me a joke about geese"),
		),
	)

	err := openai.New().Generate(context.Background(), myThread)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(myThread)
}
```

3. Install the Go dependencies
```sh
go mod tidy
```

4. Start the example application

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

go run .

A goose fills its car with goose-line!
```
